# Introduction
Our client, a hypothetical pharmaceutical company, is looking to understand better what the data related to individuals (clients and potential clients) and various health conditions and miscellaneous attributes. The goal is to extract meaningful information that could guide future research and assist with the company rapidly expanding business and market share while focusing on and improving the wellbeing of the clients.

## Terms and defenitions

  * **Individual** - A person who has been surveyed by the NHMS (National Health Measurement Study) dataset for various attributes related to the following: demographics, examinations, dietary, questionnaire (medical history), and medication.
  
  * **Health Conditions** - Various diseases or ailments that people may inhibit, such as sleep disorders, diabetes, oral health, cholesterol.  
  
  * **The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)** - A program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.

## Data Description

The data gettered is spread into six distinct files (CSV format): Demographics, Examinations, Dietary, Laboratory, Questionnaire, and Medication.

# Business Case
Our client wants to develop new drugs that primary intent to improve the quality of life of the individuals survived. The company is interested as to whether existing data on subjects and their associated health conditions could provide advice and insight to their researcher. They have obtained the NHANES dataset and requested our assistance to perform the intended analysis.  This dataset contains individuals data along with various information, including health conditions.  

The company is interested in developing new drugs for the following health conditions: diabetes, hypertension (blood pressure), and cancer. <we can add or remove health conditions later.  At the very least, let’s keep diabetes or something>

The company, aware of our Machine Learning skills, approached us for help on the following problems:


##  First Problem: Development of Drugs

The company has a mature R&D function in relation to other pharmaceutical companies.  However, the researchers are looking for any type of edge or extra tidbit of information that might be beneficial to the researchers to develop their drugs for diabetes, hypertension, and cancer.   Also, the clinical trials are increasingly expensive for the development of new drugs for the treatment of diseases.  Is there anything in the data that could help us lower the costs? 

## Second Problem: Marketing

The marketing department is struggling with high costs of television advertisements and is interested in ways to reduce their costs while still hitting their target markets for both the advertisement of drugs and attracting candidates for trails.

## Third Problem: Reduce lab costs and create referral lists

For candidates already enrolled in Diabetes program, is there a way to tell if they have other diseases such as cancer or hypertension with the minimum amount of questions?  The cost of performing  lab costs could be reduced and if the candidates does have another disease, they could be used as a referral into another drug testing plan for that disease.  

The company would ask us about possible wraping the model as a robust, easy to use App that could be present to managment and corporate to assist with the decision making, based on a few user inputs.

# Analytical Reframing for the Business Case.  

The **first business problem** involves finding commonality between individuals. This is a clustering problem and we will need a model using a clustering algorithm. We need to determine whether the business’s presumption is accurate:

* According to their health conditions, can subjects be divided into discrete groups that could provide meaningful data for the drug researchers?  
* Can this information be useful to reduce the costs of clinical trials?  
* We’re comparing the columns of the dataset.

If this is the case, we need to find clusters of subjects that segregate the data by health conditions and report these findings to the business.  

The **second business problem** involves using “health condition” features and finding related features. This is an association problem and we will need a model using an association algorithm.  For this, we only need to use diet and demographic data potentially.  This is a marketing problem so other attributes may not be applicable.  

* What features are associated with “health condition” features?
* We’re comparing the rows of the dataset.

The **third business problem** is a supervised machine learning problem.  Using the least amount of information, if a individual has diabetes, can we predict whether they have either hypertension or cancer (or both)?  

## How do we define "health condition" features within the dataset ? 
For the association problem, we will need to see which attributes are tied to the "health condition" features. In order to achieve this, we are postulating that the following columns/features of the Questionnaire dataset indicate that an individual has a "health condition":

### Diabetes
DIQ010 - Doctor told you have diabetes
https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/DIQ_H.htm
The next questions are about specific medical conditions. {Other than during pregnancy, {have you/has SP}/{Have you/Has SP}} ever been told by a doctor or health professional that {you have/{he/she/SP} has} diabetes or sugar diabetes?

### Hypertension(bllod pressure)
 BPQ020 - Ever told you had high blood pressure
 https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/BPQ_H.htm
{Have you/Has SP} ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that {you/s/he} had hypertension, also called high blood pressure?

### Cancer
 MCQ220 - Ever told you had cancer or malignancy
 https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/MCQ_H.htm#MCQ220
 {Have you/Has SP} ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that {you/s/he} had cancer or a malignancy (ma-lig-nan-see) of any kind?

# Data cleaning

<Describe what needs to happen to the data files> 

As indicated earlier, the dataset consists of six raw data files: Demographics, Examinations, Dietary, Laboratory, Questionnaire, and Medication. The largest dataset, in terms of attributes, contains 953 variables, while the smallest one contains 47 variables.

Because this is a large amount of data, with over a thousand attributes cumulatively, we decided to employ the following guidelines to reduce the complexity of the data: 

* If more than 25% of the values are missing for an attribute(column), we will consider removing the column from further evaluation.
* If the majority of attributes are missing 25% or more of their values for a given dataset, we will use business and expert judgement to select a smaller subset of values of interest subjectively. Of these subsets of missing values, we will decide how to impute the values on these attributes.     

Ideally, we would like to analyze and impute every attribute with missing values, but in this situation, it may not be practical due to the large volume of missing data. 


```{eval=FALSE, r, warning = F, message=F}
# Reading files
demographic   = read.csv("Data/Raw/demographic.csv", header = TRUE, na.strings = c("NA","","#NA"))
diet          = read.csv("Data/Raw/diet.csv", header = TRUE, na.strings = c("NA","","#NA"))
examination   = read.csv("Data/Raw/examination.csv", header = TRUE, na.strings = c("NA","","#NA"))

medications   = read.csv("Data/Raw/medications.csv", header = TRUE, na.strings = c("NA","","#NA"))
questionnaire = read.csv("Data/Raw/questionnaire.csv", header = TRUE, na.strings = c("NA","","#NA"))
# Merging files
data_list = list(demographic,examination,diet,labs,questionnaire,medications)
data_joined = join_all(data_list)
```

## Checking for missing data

It is always essentialto check for missing values and consider how to addreess them in the model.

We decided to represent the Demographic and Diet datasets as they are mostly complete.

We found that the percentage of missing data in four of the six spreadsheets is very significant. Almost all attributes/columns have varying degrees of missing values.

### Demographic

demographic_MS <- demographic_MS[demographic_MS$percent_missing > 0.0, ] 
demographic_MS_plot  <- ggplot(demographic_MS, aes(x = reorder(variables,percent_missing), 
                                                   y = percent_missing)) +

## Data Imputation

As per our guidelines, we will select attributes/columns of interest based on our business/personal judgements. The full NHANES data dictionary/variable list is available at the following URL:

https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2013

We first remove the variables having near zero variance in the dataset.Later we will remove the variables having more that 25% missing values in the dataset for Demographics.

```{r, eval=F, echo=TRUE, warning = F, message=F}


if (length(nearZeroVar(demographic_major, freqCut = 90/2, uniqueCut = 10, saveMetrics = FALSE,
                       names = FALSE, foreach = FALSE, allowParallel = TRUE)) > 0){
  demographic_major <- demographic_major[, -nearZeroVar(demographic_major, freqCut = 90/2, uniqueCut = 10, saveMetrics = FALSE,
                                                        names = FALSE, foreach = FALSE, allowParallel = TRUE)] 
  
}


# Check the columns for missing values >25%

sapply(demographic_major, function(x) ((sum(is.na(x))))*.01) %>%
  stack %>% rev %>% filter(values > 25) %>% setNames(nm=c("variable", "missing"))


Null_Num <- apply(demographic_major, 2, function(x) length(which(is.na(x) | x == "NA"))/length(x))
Null_Colms <- colnames(demographic_major)[Null_Num > 0.25]
demographic75 <- select(demographic_major, -Null_Colms)
  
```

We will now refer to our Dictionary for making a reference dataframe to differentiate between different forms of variables in a fast and effective way:



```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

demographic_indexed <- demographic75
colnames(demographic_indexed) <- with(Dictionary,
                                      Dictionary$Variable.Description[match(colnames(demographic75),
                                                                            Dictionary$Variable.Name,
                                                                            nomatch = Dictionary$Variable.Name
                                      )])

Demogramphic_Col_Labels <- data.frame("Code"=c(colnames(demographic75)), 
                                      "Desp"=c(colnames(demographic_indexed)))
```


\pagebreak

 Categorization of variables

 
 We have to now enter categorization of Factor/Numeric/ 'Computation not required' in the excel file generated <br />
* Only to be done in 3rd column...<br />
* Code is....<br />
* **0** = Factor requiring no computation.<br />
* **1** = Numeric requiring computation.<br />
* **2** = Factor requiring computation.<br />
* **Please write Column name for the category as "Cat" **<br />
Reading Index again
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

Cat_demo <- c(0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)
Demogramphic_Col_Labels <- data.frame(Demogramphic_Col_Labels,Cat = Cat_demo)

```
Now we prepare the dataset for impute from all the information.
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

Catcolmn <- Demogramphic_Col_Labels[Demogramphic_Col_Labels$Cat ==2 , 2 ] 
Numcolmn <- Demogramphic_Col_Labels[Demogramphic_Col_Labels$Cat ==1 , 2 ] 
Catcolmn_Nul <- Demogramphic_Col_Labels[Demogramphic_Col_Labels$Cat ==0 , 2 ] 
WorkingColm <- c(Catcolmn_Nul, Numcolmn, Catcolmn)
WorkingColm
)
demographic_selected = demographic75[ Catcolmn_Nul ]

demographic_selected = demographic75[ WorkingColm ]

demographic_selected[, Catcolmn] <- sapply(demographic_selected[, Catcolmn], as.numeric)
demographic_selected[, Catcolmn_Nul] <- sapply(demographic_selected[, Catcolmn_Nul], as.numeric)
demographic_selected[, Numcolmn] <- sapply(demographic_selected[, Numcolmn], as.numeric)

```

### Demographic 
We have selected the following 8 relevant columns among the 32 that have less than 25% of missing values:


<!-- * **ID (SEQN)** - Respondent sequence number.. -->
<!-- * **Gender (RIAGENDR)** - Gender of the participant.. -->
<!-- * **Age (RIDAGEYR)** - Age in years of the participant at the time of screening. Individuals 80 and over are topcoded at 80 years of age.. -->
<!-- * **Race (RIDRETH3)** - Recode of reported race and Hispanic origin information, with Non-Hispanic Asian Category. -->
<!-- * **Country_of_birth (DMDBORN4)** - In what country {were you/was SP} born?. -->
<!-- * **Citizenship_status (DMDCITZN)** - {Are you/Is SP} a citizen of the United States? [Information about citizenship is being collected by the U.S. Public Health Service to perform health related research. Providing this information is voluntary and is collected under the authority of the Public Health Service Act. There will be no effect on pending immigration or citizenship petitions.]. -->
<!-- * **Family_members (DMDFMSIZ)** - Total number of people in the Family. -->
<!-- * **Marital_status (DMDHRMAR)** - HH reference person's marital status. -->
<!-- * **Family_income (INDFMIN2)** - Total family income (reported as a range value in dollars). -->

Now we will label the dataset for visualizations.

#### Conclusion
Our samples is pretty representative of the US population: 

* The  US age structure is 20% under 15, 67% between 15 and 64 years old, and 13% over 65 (https://countrymeters.info/en/United_States_of_America_(USA)). 
* The Gender ratio is 51% for female and 49% for male (http://statisticstimes.com/demographics/countries-by-sex-ratio.php)
* The Race and ethnicity are:  White 	72.4%, Hispanic and Latino Americans  16.3%, Black or African American 	12.6%, Asian 	4.8%, Native 1.1 %, and the others 9.1 %.


### Diet
<!-- https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/variablelist.aspx?Component=Dietary&CycleBeginYear=2013 -->

First we would remove all the Near Zero Variance features from the data set, Cutt off being 45% :

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
diet_major <- diet

if (length(nearZeroVar(diet_major, freqCut = 90/2, uniqueCut = 10, saveMetrics = FALSE,
                       names = FALSE, foreach = FALSE, allowParallel = TRUE)) > 0){
  diet_major <- diet_major[, -nearZeroVar(diet_major, freqCut = 90/2, uniqueCut = 10, saveMetrics = FALSE,

Null_Colms_diet <- colnames(diet_major)[Null_Num_diet > 0.25]
diet75 <- select(diet_major, -Null_Colms_diet)

colSums(is.na(diet75))
diet75 %>% summarise_all(~(sum(is.na(.))/n()*100))

### Labs
<!-- https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/variablelist.aspx?Component=Laboratory&CycleBeginYear=2013 -->


First we would remove all the Near Zero Variance features from the data set, Cutt off being 45% :

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}


labsdata_major <- labs

if (length(nearZeroVar(labsdata_major, freqCut = 90/2, uniqueCut = 10, saveMetrics = FALSE,
                       names = FALSE, foreach = FALSE, allowParallel = TRUE)) > 0){
  labsdata_major <- labsdata_major[, -nearZeroVar(labsdata_major, freqCut = 90/2, uniqueCut = 10, saveMetrics = FALSE,
                                                  names = FALSE, foreach = FALSE, allowParallel = TRUE)] 
  
}

```


\pagebreak


Now, we will remove the features having a missing values of more that 25% as decided before:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}


Null_Num_labsdata <- apply(labsdata_major, 2, function(x) length(which(x == "" | is.na(x) | x == "NA" | x == "-999" ))/length(x))
Null_Colms_labsdata <- colnames(labsdata_major)[Null_Num_labsdata > 0.35]
labsdata75 <- select(labsdata_major, -Null_Colms_labsdata)


```

We have selected the following 9 relevant columns among the 46 that have less than 25% of missing values:

* **ID (SEQN)** - Respondent sequence number..
* **White_blood_cells_labs (LBXWBCSI)** - White blood cell count (1000 cells/uL).
* **Red_bloods_cells_labs (LBXRBCSI)** - Red blood cell count (million cells/uL).
* **Caffeine_labs (PHQ020)** - Coffee or tea with cream or sugar? [Include milk or non-dairy creamers.].
* **Alcohol_labs (PHQ030)** - Alcohol, such as beer, wine, or liquor?.
* **Supplements_labs (PHQ060)** - Dietary supplements such as vitamins and minerals? [Include multivitamins and single nutrient supplements.].
* **Hepatitis_a_labs (LBXHA)** - Hepatitis A antibody.
* **Hepatitis_b_labs (LBXHBC)** - Hepatitis B core antibody.
* **Cholesterol_labs (LBXTC)** - Total Cholesterol( mg/dL).


We will now refer to our Dictionary for making a reference dataframe to differentiate between different forms of variables in a fast and effective way:

* **Spent_total (CBD070)** - The next questions are about how much money {your family spends/you spend} on food. First I'll ask you about money spent at supermarkets or grocery stores. Then we will talk about money spent at other types of stores. During the past 30 days, how much money {did your family/did you} spend at supermarkets or grocery stores? Please include purchases made with food stamps..
* **Spent_groceries (CBD110)** - About how much money {did your family/did you} spend on food at these types of stores? (Please do not include any stores you have already told me about.).
* **Spent_vending (CBD120)** - During the past 30 days, how much money {did your family/did you} spend on eating out? Please include money spent in cafeterias at work or at school or on vending machines, for all family members..
* **Spent_delivered (CBD130)** - During the past 30 days, how much money {did your family/did you} spend on food carried out or delivered? Please do not include money you have already told me about..
* **Cold_30 (HSQ500)** - Did {you/SP} have a head cold or chest cold that started during those 30 days?.
* **Stomach_30 (HSQ510)** - Did {you/SP} have a stomach or intestinal illness with vomiting or diarrhea that started during those 30 days?.
* **Flu_30 (HSQ520)** - Did {you/SP} have flu, pneumonia, or ear infections that started during those 30 days?.
* **Diabetes (DIQ010)** - The next questions are about specific medical conditions. {Other than during pregnancy, {have you/has SP}/{Have you/Has SP}} ever been told by a doctor or health professional that {you have/{he/she/SP} has} diabetes or sugar diabetes?.
* **Taking_insuline (DIQ050)** - {Is SP/Are you} now taking insulin.
* **Milk_30 (DBQ197)** - Now I'm going to ask a few questions about milk products. Do not include their use in cooking. In the past 30 days, how often did {you/SP} have milk to drink or on {your/his/her} cereal? Please include chocolate and other flavored milks as well as hot cocoa made with milk.

We will now refer to our Dictionary for making a reference dataframe to differentiate between different forms of variables in a fast and effective way:

 Categorization of variables

 
 We have to now enter categorization of Factor/Numeric/ 'Computation not required' in the excel file generated <br />
* Only to be done in 3rd column...<br />
* Code is....<br />
* **0** = Factor requiring no computation.<br />
* **1** = Numeric requiring computation.<br />
* **2** = Factor requiring computation.<br />
* **Please write Column name for the category as "Cat" **<br />

From the above graphs, we notice is that the first 4 components has an Eigenvalue >1 
and explains almost 60% of variance! We can not effectively reduce dimensionality from 8  to 4 becuase we will lose about 40% of variance!

With just use the first two components, no diseases present separation between sick and healthy people 
. This  clearly  indicate that the we can not do classification base only on the demographics data.

}
k.values <- 1:10
demo8_iss_values <- map_dbl(k.values, demo8_iss)
plot(k.values, demo8_iss_values,
     type="b", pch = 19, frame = FALSE,
     xlab="Number of clusters K",
     ylab="Total intra-clusters sum of squares")
```

From the above graph, we conclude that 6 is the appropriate number of clusters 
since it seems to be appearing at the bend in the elbow plot.

Now, let us take k = 6 as our optimal cluster

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

demo8_k6<-kmeans(demo_subset_8[,2:9],6,iter.max=100,nstart=50,algorithm="Lloyd")
demo8_k6

 From the above visualization, we observe that in the clusters distribution both Male and female  have almost the same range of age

# Problem 1: Clustering

In this section, we will combine all the datasets and perform clustering algorithms.

# Problem 2: Unsupervised Association 

Find associations with diseases and diet/demographics data.  

## Introduction
Associating mining if often used with market basket analysis.  However, for healthcare dataset used NHANES, we will explore the associations between the data and attempt to provide value to addressing marketing business problems for the pharmedical company in adversiting their drugs and attracting individuals to clinical trails.  

## Preparing the data for association algorithms.

Our first task is to prepare the data for associating mining algorithms.  

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# Take interesting attributes from "data_selected" data
# "data_selected" is a subset of all the dataset combined.
association_dataset <- data_selected
association_target_dataset <- target_disease_dataset[ -c(2,3,4)]

# Merge our association data with the target dataset 
# Target dataset contains all diseases (diabetes, cancer, hypertension)
association_dataset <- merge(association_dataset, association_target_dataset,by="ID")

```

Since the associations rules will reference the values of the attributes.  If a value says "Yes", it might be ambigious what this means.  However, if the value was, "US Citizen", then the meaning would be  precise.    Below are a couple of examples where, we have re-coded the values for attributes as shown below:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
association_dataset <- association_dataset %>%
  mutate(Milk_30   = recode(Milk_30 ,
                                      "Never" =	"Does not drink milk",	
                                      "Often-once a day or more?"  =	"Drinks milk multiple times a day",	
                                      "Rarely-less than once a week "  =	"Drinks milk once a week",
                                      "Refused" = "Might be a milk drinker",
                                      "Sometimes-once a week or more, but less than once a day" = "Drinks milk multiple times a week",
                                      "Varied"  = "Might be a milk drinker"
  ) )

association_dataset <- association_dataset %>%
  mutate(Food_assistance   = recode(Food_assistance ,
                            "No" =	"Has not requested emergency food assistance",	
                            "Refused"  =	"Unknown if emergency food assistance was requested",	
                            "Yes"  =	"Has requested emergency food assistance"
  ) )

association_dataset <- association_dataset %>%
  mutate(Insurance_current   = recode(Insurance_current ,
                                    "No" =	"No health insurance coverage",	
                                    "Refused"  =	"Health insurance coverage unknown",	
                                    "Unknown"  =	"Health insurance coverage unknown",
                                    "Yes"    = "Has health insurance coverage"
  ) )


association_dataset <- association_dataset %>%
  mutate(HAS_CANCER   = recode(HAS_CANCER ,
                                 "YES" =	"HAS CANCER",	
                                 "NO"  =	"NO CANCER"
  ) )

```

The above recoding was performed for 18 attributes.  Within the association dataset, we selected 18 attributes.  We focused on attributes that were categorial values.  For the purpose of association mining, numerical values may not add value unless they are binned into categories. For now, we have focused on 18 attributes that were available in the cleaned dataset. Sincer, the dataset is rich with many attributes.  In the future, more attributes could be added into association mining algorithms if the business finds value in the suggestions of this type of analysis.

## Transform dataset into a transactional dataset

In order to apply association algorithms, the dataset has to transformed into a tranactional dataset.  First, we need to merge all categorical values requiring for mining into a single description attriubte:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# Select columns required for mining analysis
association_test_columns <- c("ID", "Gender", "Race", "Country_of_birth", "Citizenship_status",
                              'Marital_status', "Family_income", "Dominant_hand_exam", "Milk_30", "Food_assistance",
                              "Insurance_current", "Health_institution", "Gaming_hours", "Smoking_relatives", "Ride_motor_vehicle",
                              'HAS_DIABETES', 'HAS_CANCER', 'HAS_HYPERTENSION')

subset_association = subset(association_dataset, select=association_test_columns)

# Add a description attribute with all the attributes requried for unsupervised association mining analysis 
subset_association <- subset_association %>% 
  mutate(description= paste(subset_association$Race, ",",
                            subset_association$Gender, ",",
                            subset_association$Country_of_birth, ",",
                            subset_association$Citizenship_status, ",",
                            subset_association$Marital_status, ",",
                            subset_association$Family_income, ",",
                            subset_association$Dominant_hand_exam, ",",
                            subset_association$Milk_30, ",",
                            subset_association$Food_assistance, ",", 
                            subset_association$Insurance_current, ",",
                            subset_association$Health_institution, ",",
                            subset_association$Gaming_hours, ",",
                            subset_association$Smoking_relatives, ",",
                            subset_association$Ride_motor_vehicle, "," ,
                            subset_association$HAS_DIABETES, ",",
                            subset_association$HAS_CANCER, ",", 
                            subset_association$HAS_HYPERTENSION
                            ))

#Group descriptions by individual IDs and place into transactionData dataset.
transactionData <- ddply(subset_association, c("ID"),
                         function(subset_association)paste(subset_association$description))

# Remove the ID from the transaction dataset as it is not used.
transactionData$ID <- NULL

# Write the transaction dataset
write.csv(transactionData, "Data/Working/transactiondata.csv", quote=FALSE , row.names = FALSE)

# Read in the transaction dataset for use with the unsupervised algorithms
individuals_transaction_class <- read.transactions('Data/Working/transactiondata.csv', format = 'basket',sep=',')
```

## Apply Association algorithms to the data 

Now data is prepared, we can apply the association algorithms.  

### Frequent values 

First, we create association rules against the dataset.  

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# Create mining rules for all values.  This will tell us which values are likely to be found together
rules_for_individuals <- apriori(individuals_transaction_class, parameter = list(supp=0.001, conf=0.85, maxlen=5))
```


We plot the 20 most frequent values found within the data. 

![](Figures/absolute_value_frequency_plot.png){width=500px}

Per the above, as expected, US citizen, right-handed, born in US are some of the most frequent values.  Also, it is also that the values for not having diseases is also at the top of the list.  

OVer 400,000 rules are produced for entire data, let's take a glance at 5 of them below.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
 inspect(rules_for_individuals[1:5])
    lhs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         rhs                                               support confidence     lift count

```

In the above output, we can see different association mining rules for the entire dataset.  The rules have LHS and RHS which demonstrate the relation between itemsets(collections of values).  The items on LHS are associated and occur with the single item on the RHS. Now we will proceed to create association rules for having and not having the particular diseases (cancer, diabetes, hypertension).  The RHS will be set to the particular health conditions/disases.  And we will observe what typse of associations are discovered on the LHS. 


### Association rules for having diseases

In order to produce a list of association rules, we had to experiement with "conf"(confidence) parameter.  For example, with positive cancer rules, we had to lower the confidence to 0.4 to produce mining rules.  For each health condition(disaease),we have created 2 sets of rules.  The first set of rules allow larger number of items to be produced on the LHS (maxlen=15); whereas, the second set of rules forces the rules to have a small amount of rules (maxlen=3).  

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# Association for having cancer (large itemset allowed on LHS, maxlen=15)
has_cancer.association.rules <- apriori(individuals_transaction_class, parameter = list(supp=0.001, conf=0.4, maxlen=15), appearance=list(default="lhs", rhs="HAS CANCER"))

# Association for having cancer (small itemset allowed on LHS, maxlen=3)
has_cancer.association.rules_smallitemset <- apriori(individuals_transaction_class, parameter = list(supp=0.001, conf=0.1, maxlen=3), appearance=list(default="lhs", rhs="HAS CANCER"))

# Association for having diabetes (large itemset allowed on LHS, maxlen=15)
has_diabetes.association.rules <- apriori(individuals_transaction_class, parameter = list(supp=0.001, conf=0.7, maxlen=15), appearance=list(default="lhs", rhs="HAS DIABETES"))

# Association for having diabetes (small itemset allowed on LHS, maxlen=3)
has_diabetes.association.rules_smallitemset <- apriori(individuals_transaction_class, parameter = list(supp=0.001, conf=0.4, maxlen=3), appearance=list(default="lhs", rhs="HAS DIABETES"))

# Association for having hypertension (large itemset allowed on LHS, maxlen=15)
has_hypertension.association.rules_smallitemset <- apriori(individuals_transaction_class, parameter = list(supp=0.001, conf=0.4, maxlen=3), appearance=list(default="lhs", rhs="HAS HYPERTENSION"))

# Association for having hypertension (small itemset allowed on LHS, maxlen=3)
has_hypertension.association.rules <- apriori(individuals_transaction_class, parameter = list(supp=0.001, conf=0.8, maxlen=15), appearance=list(default="lhs", rhs="HAS HYPERTENSION"))

```

Now with association rules, we can examine them and observe the LHS items that are found in conjunction with various diseases: 

### Cancer: Association Rules

### Association rules for not having diseases

In the precedin section, we looked at associations for having diseases.  For this section, we look at the inverse, could their value in associations where there is no diseases/health conditions?  

## Conclusion for Problem 2

# Problem 3: Supervised 


Target attributes need to be added .   



## Create target dataset

As part of the business problem, we focusing on 3 targets(diabetes, hypertension, cancer):

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#DIQ010 - Doctor told you have diabetes
#https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/DIQ_H.htm
#The next questions are about specific medical conditions. {Other than during pregnancy, {have you/has SP}/{Have you/Has SP}} ever been told by a doctor or health professional that {you have/{he/she/SP} has} diabetes or sugar diabetes?

# BPQ020 - Ever told you had high blood pressure
# https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/BPQ_H.htm
# {Have you/Has SP} ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that {you/s/he} had hypertension, also called high blood pressure?

# MCQ220 - Ever told you had cancer or malignancy
# https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/MCQ_H.htm#MCQ220
# {Have you/Has SP} ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that {you/s/he} had cancer or a malignancy (ma-lig-nan-see) of any kind?

# Create the target dataset for the Supervised problem.
temp_questionnaire = read.csv("Data/Raw/questionnaire.csv", header = TRUE, na.strings = c("NA","","#NA"))
target_columns <- c("SEQN","DIQ010","BPQ020","MCQ220")
target_disease_dataset = subset(temp_questionnaire, select=target_columns)

# Change disease indicators into factors
target_disease_dataset$MCQ220 <- as.factor(target_disease_dataset$MCQ220)
target_disease_dataset$DIQ010 <- as.factor(target_disease_dataset$DIQ010)
target_disease_dataset$BPQ020 <- as.factor(target_disease_dataset$BPQ020)

#Create new column for target values
target_disease_dataset = cbind(target_disease_dataset, HAS_DIABETES= ifelse(target_disease_dataset$DIQ010 == 1, "YES", "NO" ) )
target_disease_dataset= cbind(target_disease_dataset, HAS_HYPERTENSION= ifelse(target_disease_dataset$BPQ020 == 1, "YES", "NO" ) )
target_disease_dataset = cbind(target_disease_dataset, HAS_CANCER= ifelse(target_disease_dataset$MCQ220 == 1, "YES", "NO" ) )
summary(target_disease_dataset)

# With new target values, set "NA" to "NO"
target_disease_dataset$HAS_DIABETES[is.na(target_disease_dataset$HAS_DIABETES)] <- "NO"
target_disease_dataset$HAS_HYPERTENSION[is.na(target_disease_dataset$HAS_HYPERTENSION)] <- "NO"
target_disease_dataset$HAS_CANCER[is.na(target_disease_dataset$HAS_CANCER)] <- "NO"
summary(target_disease_dataset)

```

Given an individual has diabetes, predict individual has cancer or hypertension.  Use the less amount of data possible to keep costs low.

```

### DEMOGRAPHIC DATA MINING FOR DIABETES

We now will keep the associated features related to Diabetes disease using PCA and Correlation plots.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# Correlation for Demographics
combi_cor=rcorr(as.matrix(Demo_target[,-c(1,2)]))
corrplot(combi_cor$r, type = "upper", order = "hclust", tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45)



####### Using PCA 
Test_Data<-scale(Demo_target[,-c(1,2)])
Demo_target2 <-Demo_target
pcmp <- princomp(Test_Data,retx=TRUE, cor =TRUE, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE)

Demo_target2 <- as.data.frame(cbind(Demo_target2, pcmp$scores[,1:5]))

```

#### Correlation Plot:
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
corrplot(combi_cor$r, type = "upper", order = "hclust", tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45)

```

```


![](Figures/combined/combined_PCA1.png){width=350px}
![](Figures/combined/combined_PCA2.png){width=350px}


We notice is that the first 9 components has an Eigenvalue >1 
and explains almost 80% of variance. 
So if  wereduce dimensionality from 35  to 8  we will lose 
  20% of variance!

![](Figures/combined/combined_PCA3.png){width=350px}
![](Figures/combined/combined_PCA_diabetes.png){width=350px}

The two first components explains only 30%  of the variance. 
We need 18 principal components to explain more than 95% of the variance 
and 27 to explain more than 0.99

require(caret)
require(dplyr)
require(caretEnsemble)
require(pROC)

data_index <- createDataPartition(combined_target_final$TARGET, p=0.75, list = FALSE)
train_Combined <- combined_target_final[data_index,-c(1,2,39,40,41,42) ]
test_Combined <- combined_target_final[-data_index, -c(1,2,39,40,41,42)]

 #try to predict class probabilities in R - caret
levels(train_Combined$TARGET) <- make.names(levels(factor(train_Combined$TARGET)))
levels(test_Combined$TARGET) <- make.names(levels(factor(test_Combined$TARGET)))
#train_Combined$TARGET =  as.factor(train_Combined$TARGET)
#test_Combined$TARGET =  as.factor(test_Combined$TARGET)

```

We see here that KNN have a great variability depending of the processed sample. 
The other models achieve a great auc with a very low variability

# Conclusion 

With our models, we aim to present the following to the business regarding applications of our models to assist with drug deployment: 

Firstly, for different diseases, our models can help identify related attributes/values (clusters) for a given disease.  
This will help select suitable patients for trials.  Trial process can be costly.  And we reduce the cost. 
 Additionally, this information can also be used to provide hints to researchers on drug treatments on the what might could helpful.    
(PROVIDE EXAMPLE WHEN AVAILABLE)

For different diseases, our app can different types of non-medical (diet/demographics) which are related.  
- This can help with directed marketing of our current and future drugs for those diseases.    
- This could also assist with marketing to attract potential candidates for trails.
