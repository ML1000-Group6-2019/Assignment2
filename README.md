The following is a hypothetical business problem: A pharmaceutical company is looking to better understand what the data related to subjects and various health conditions and miscellaneous attributes.

## Business Case

A pharmaceutical company wants to produce new drugs.  The company is curious as to whether existing data on subjects and their associated health conditions could provide advice and insight to their drug researchers.  They have obtained NHMS dataset.  This dataset contains subject/patient data along with various information including health conditions.  

The company is interested in producing new drugs for the following health conditions: diabetes and hypertension/cholesterol (we can add or remove health conditions later.  At the very least, letâ€™s keep diabetes or something). 


## First Problem: 
What types of symptoms, medications, diet, demographics are common among various health conditions (such as diabetes)?  For example, what types of dietary factors are  commonly found with diabetes?        

## Second Problem: 
Are their any commonalities between various people with the same health conditions?  For example, if subject 1 and subject 2 have the same health condition (for example, diabetes) what other similarities would these subjects have?  

## Data Description:

The data is spread against 6 spreadsheets (CSV): Demographics, Examinations, Dietary, Laboratory, Questionnaire, and Medication.
